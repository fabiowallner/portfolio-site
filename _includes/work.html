I used jekyll as a base and made it work with jade and sass to make the process of creating content easier. The draft was done in photoshop. It's completely responsive and works on all device sizes, from phones to tablets and pcs.</p><div class="tags"><span>#design</span><span>#photoshop</span><span>#jekyll</span><span>#jade</span><span>#html5</span><span>#sass</span></div></div><div class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/img/fabiowallner.com.jpg"/></div></div><div class="project project-2"><div class="description"><h3>Rodel mit Bremse</h3><p>Rodel mit Bremse is a small company in Austria. They create traditional wooden sledges with brakes to make riding safer and more fun. The website is also done using jekyll because they did not need a complicated cms system. I created the logo, the website design and also finished the website using jade, sass and some JQuery.
